  <h1>Adopt a Dog!</h1>
  <img id="dog" src="images/blacklab.jpg" alt="Save A Furry Friend!">
	<h2> Should you own a dog? </h2>
	<p id="p1"> Yes! Yes! Yes! Owning your own furry friend is a must for every home and family. Adopting a dog is great for comfort and home security along with all the great companionship that comes with owning your own dog. The unconditional love given to
	you by your four legged friend will surpass any affection you could receive from any person.</p>
	<h2> When should i adopt? </h2>
	<p id="p2"> Adopt as soon as you feel your life is ready to take on a new role in your life. Adopting a pet is a great thing to do but it also entails a lot of work. Be smart about your adoption. If you want to adopt but it jst isnt time, then don't.
	Your pet needs as much attention as you do so make sure you can provide this before you adopt.</p>
	<h2> Where does my adoption payment go towards? </h2>
	<p id="p3"> All adoption fees go directly back towards the care taking and sheltering of all un-adopted animals. We are non-for-profit and take all fees as a donation towards the shelter.</p>
